## Description
For our first week of JavaScript, we were required to produce a randomized password generator. 

For this project we were provided with starter code for CSS, HTML and JS (to be modified). The CSS and HTML were fully completed as the central goal was building JavaScript skills and understanding. It was imperative that the user be able to select the paramenters of their password, inclusive of character lenth, case-sensitivity, numerical values and special characters. 

The objective was to be able to produce strong passwords, that employees with exposure to sensitive information can utilise. 


## Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

Personally, I found this challenge very difficult, however, throughout the process I've defintiely become more comfortable working with JavaScript and am looking forward to building on those skills.

TO BE NOTED:
Our TA went through and assisted us with the project during class hours, as the instructor was away that day... so there will be similarities in code, as it was a collabrative effort.
